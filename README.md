# text-generator-markov

**usage:**
* put a *file.txt* with your text data in the project directory. 
* change *FILEPATH* to be your *file.txt* path
* change *STATESPATH* to *your\project\directory\states.txt*
* change *SAVEFILEPATH* to *your\project\directory\matrix.txt*
* change *GENERATEDSTUFF* to *your\project\directory\generatedstuff.txt*

And run it. It will generate 10000 words, but you can change it by changing the value of *number*

I added input data from transcription of some Bob Ross episode.
